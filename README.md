📅 Document Renewal Reminder App

A simple yet powerful web application that helps users track and get reminded about important document renewal dates — such as ID cards, passports, licenses, or any official paperwork — before they expire.

This project starts as a frontend-based app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will evolve into a full-stack application with Node.js, Express, SQL, and React in the future.
